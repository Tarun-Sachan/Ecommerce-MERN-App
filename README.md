## Future Updates

To the store front -
<br>
1.Add categories and user account page.

2.Add categories sorting in store front-end.

3.Add user login and authentication for order management and features like wishlist.

## Current known Bugs

1. When trying to implement Log Out functionality. User is unable to login again. Current solution is to drop table and loose all store data. Therefore I have not included the logout function in this build.
